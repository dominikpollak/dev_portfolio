# dev_portfolio

This is my developer portfolio / CV.

The design of this website was inspired by the first MAC OS from 1984.

This site contains the folder my_projects where are links to my main projects located.

In the about_me.txt file you will find some basic information about me and my skills.

Site is fully responsive.
